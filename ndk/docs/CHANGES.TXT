Android NDK ChangeLog:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
current version

IMPORTANT BUG FIXES:

- Fix build/host-setup.sh to:
  * execute as a Bourne shell script
  * remove unused host gcc dependency
  * improve Windows host auto-detection
  * add GNU Make version check
  * add Nawk/Gawk check
  * ensure that the script is run from $NDKROOT as build/host-setup.sh
  * add --help, --verbose, --no-awk-check and --no-make-check options

- Properly add sysroot library search path at build time. This makes a line
  in Android.mk like:

     LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz

  Actually work correctly, instead of having the linker complaining that it
  could not find the corresponding libz.so library. Also clear LOCAL_LDLIBS
  in $(CLEAR_VARS) script.


IMPORTANT CHANGES

- The 'sources' directory is gone. The NDK build system now looks for
  $(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/jni/Android.mk by default. You can override this with
  the new APP_BUILD_SCRIPT variable in Application.mk

  For example, the 'hello-jni' sample uses the following files:

    apps/hello-jni/project/jni/Android.mk
    apps/hello-jni/project/jni/hello-jni.c

  The 'apps/<name>' directory is still needed in this release though.

- Change LOCAL_CFLAGS / LOCAL_CPPFLAGS to work as in the full Android build
  system. This means that:

    - LOCAL_CFLAGS   is now used for *both* C and C++ sources  (was only for C)
    - LOCAL_CPPFLAGS is now used for C++ sources only (was for both C and C++)
    - LOCAL_CXXFLAGS is used like LOCAL_CPPFLAGS but is considered obsolete.
      (will disappear in next release)

  Also fixed APP_CPPFLAGS / APP_CFLAGS / APP_CXXFLAGS correspondingly.

- Rename build/platforms/android-1.5 to build/platforms/android-3 to match
  the Android API level instead of the marketing speak.

  Also add a new build/platforms/android-4, and make the build system select
  which platform to use based on the content of the project file named
  $(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/default.properties.

- Add OpenGL ES 1.x headers and libraries to the android-4 stable APIs.
  (NOTE: they are *not* available for android-3)

  Also provide a small port of the "San Angeles Observation" demo to show
  how to make a simple Android application that uses them.


OTHER FIXES & CHANGES

- Generate thumb binaries by default.

- Add support for LOCAL_ARM_MODE in Android.mk.

- Add support for the '.arm' suffix in source file names to force the
  compilation of a single source in arm (32-bit) mode.

- Generate proper unoptimized versions of binaries when APP_OPTIM := debug

- Add support for LOCAL_C_INCLUDES in Android.mk

- Fix compilation of assembler files (e.g. foo.S)
