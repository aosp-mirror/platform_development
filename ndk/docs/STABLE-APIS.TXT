Android NDK Stable APIs:
========================

This is the list of stable APIs/ABIs exposed by the Android NDK.

I. Purpose:
-----------

Each API corresponds to a set of headers files, and a shared library file
that contains the corresponding implementation, and which must be linked
against by your native code.

For example, to use system library "Foo", you would include a header
like <foo.h> in your code, then tell the build system that your native
module needs to link to /system/lib/libfoo.so at load-time by adding
the following line to your Android.mk file:

  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lfoo

Note that the build system automatically links the C library, the Math
library and the C++ support library to your native code, there is no
need to list them in a LOCAL_LDLIBS line.



II. Android 1.5 Stable Native APIs:
-----------------------------------

All the APIs listed below are available for developing native code that
runs on Android 1.5 system images and above.

The C Library:
--------------

The C library headers, as they are defined on Android 1.5 are available
through their standard names (<stdlib.h>, <stdio.h>, etc...). If one header
is not there at build time, it's because its implementation is not available
on a 1.5 system image.

The build system automatically links your native modules to the C library,
you don't need to add it to LOCAL_LDLIBS.

Note that the Android C library includes support for pthread (<pthread.h>),
so "LOCAL_LIBS := -lpthread" is not needed. The same is true for real-time
extensions (-lrt on typical Linux distributions).


** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: ******************************************************
*
*  The kernel-specific headers in <linux/...> and <asm/...> are not considered
*  stable at this point. Avoid including them directly because some of them
*  are likely to change in future releases of the platform. This is especially
*  true for anything related to specific hardware definitions.
*
******************************************************************************


The Math Library:
-----------------

<math.h> is available, and the math library is automatically linked to your
native modules at build time, so there is no need to list "-lm" through
LOCAL_LDLIBS.



C++ Library:
------------

An *extremely* minimal C++ support API is available. For Android 1.5, this is
currently limited to the following headers:

   <cstddef>
   <new>
   <utility>
   <stl_pair.h>

They may not contain all definitions required by the standard. Notably, support
for C++ exceptions and RTTI is not available with Android 1.5 system images.

The C++ support library (-lstdc++) is automatically linked to your native
modules too, so there is no need to list it through LOCAL_LDLIBS



Android-specific Log Support:
-----------------------------

<android/log.h> contains various definitions that can be used to send log messages
to the kernel from your native code. Please have a look at its content in
(build/platforms/android-3/common/include/android/log.h), which contain many
informative comments on how to use it.

You should be able to write helpful wrapper macros for your own usage to
access this facility.

If you use it, your native module should link to /system/lib/liblog.so with:

  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog



ZLib Compression Library:
-------------------------

<zlib.h> and <zconf.h> are available and can be used to use the ZLib compression
library available on Android 1.5 system images. Documentation for it is available
on the ZLib page: http://www.zlib.net/manual.html

If you use it, your native module should link to /system/lib/libz.so with:

  LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz
