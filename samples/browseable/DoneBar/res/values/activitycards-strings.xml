    <string name="donebaractivity_description">In this presentation, a done bar replaces the action bar entirely, providing
            two direct actions to persist or dismiss changes. This is suitable for cases where no
            additional view details or actions are needed in the action bar.</string>
    <string name="donebuttonactivity_title">Done Button</string>
    <string name="donebuttonactivity_description">In this presentation, a done button replaces the action bar\'s "Up" affordance
            and app icon, while the cancel action is made available in the action overflow. This is
            well-suited to scenarios where additional view details or
            actions may be needed in the action bar.</string>
