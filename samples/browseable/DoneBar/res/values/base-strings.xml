                This sample demonstrates two alternative presentations of the
                action bar that are well-suited for simple data entry scenarios.

                In this presentation, a done bar replaces the action
                bar entirely, providing two direct actions to persist or dismiss changes. This is
                suitable for cases where no additional view details or actions are needed in the
                action bar.
