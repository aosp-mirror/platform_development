            This sample demonstrates using RenderScript to perform basic image manipulation. Specifically, it allows users
            to dynamically adjust the saturation for an image using a slider. A custom RenderScript kernel performs the saturation
            adjustment, running the computation on the device\'s GPU or other compute hardware as deemed appropriate by the system.
