<!--
  As we're using ActionBarCompat, any action item attributes come from ActionBarCompat's XML
  namespace instead of the android namespace. Here we've added a new support namespace added to
  the menu element allowing us to use the 'showAsAction' attribute in a backwards compatible way.
  Any other action item attributes used should be referenced from this namespace too
  (actionProviderClass, actionViewClass, actionLayout).

    <!--
      To use ShareActionProvider provided by ActionBarCompat, we reference the class by set the
      support:actionProviderClass attribute with the full class name of ShareActionProvider.
    -->

        android:id="@+id/menu_share"
        android:title="@string/menu_share"

        support:showAsAction="always" />
