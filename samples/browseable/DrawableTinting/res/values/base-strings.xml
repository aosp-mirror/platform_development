            Sample that shows applying tinting and color filters to Drawables both programmatically
            and as Drawable resources in XML.
            \n\nTinting is set on a nine-patch drawable through the "tint" and "tintMode" parameters.
            A color state list is referenced as the tint color, which defines colors for different
            states of a View (for example disabled/enabled, focused, pressed or selected).
            \n\nProgrammatically, tinting is applied to a Drawable through its "setColorFilter" method,
            with a reference to a color and a PorterDuff blend mode. The color and blend mode can be
            changed from the UI to see the effect of different options.
