                This sample demonstrates how to use the Android Key Store to safely create and store
                encryption keys that only your application can access.  You can also sign data
                using those keys.\n\n
                To create a new KeyPair, click \"Create\".\n\n
                To sign some data using a KeyPair, click \"Sign\".\n\n
