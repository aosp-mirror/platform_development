<h3>Activity</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="HelloWorld.html">Hello World</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates a basic screen activity.
  <dl>
  <dt>Code:
  <dd> <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld.java</a>
  <dt>Layout:
  <dd> <a href="../../../../../../res/layout/hello_world.html">
  hello_world.xml</a>
  </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="SaveRestoreState.html">Save &amp; Restore State</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how an activity should save state when it is paused.</dd>

  <dt><a href="PersistentState.html">Persistent State</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how you can save and restore preferences, which are stored
  even after the user closes the application. </dd>

  <dt><a href="ReceiveResult.html">Receive Result</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how an activity screen can return a result to the
  activity that opened it. </dd>

  <dt><a href="Forwarding.html">Forwarding</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates opening a new activity and removing the current activity
  from the history stack, so that when the user later presses BACK they will
  not see the intermediate activity.</dd>

  <dt><a href="RedirectEnter.html">Redirection</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how to save data to preferences and use it to determine
  which activity to open next.</dd>

  <dt><a href="TranslucentActivity.html">Translucent</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how to make an activity with a transparent background. </dd>

  <dt><a href="TranslucentBlurActivity.html">TranslucentBlur</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how to make an activity with a transparent background with
  a special effect (blur). </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Service</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="LocalService.html">Local Service Controller and
        Local Service Binding</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrate the implementation of a service that runs in the same
  process as its client(s).  Shows how those clients can either start/stop it
  with {@link android.content.Context#startService
  Context.startService} and {@link android.content.Context#stopService
  Context.stopService}, or bind and call it with
  {@link android.content.Context#bindService Context.bindService} and
  {@link android.content.Context#unbindService Context.unindService}.
  This also shows how you can simplify working
  with a service when you know it will only run in your own process.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="RemoteService.html">Remote Service Controller and
        Remove Service Binding</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates starting a service in a separate process, by assigning
  <code>android:process=&quot;:remote&quot;</code> to the service in the
  AndroidManifest.xml file.  Shows how those clients can either start/stop it
  with {@link android.content.Context#startService
  Context.startService} and {@link android.content.Context#stopService
  Context.stopService}, or bind and call it with
  {@link android.content.Context#bindService Context.bindService} and
  {@link android.content.Context#unbindService Context.unindService}.
  Binding is similar to the local service sample,
  but illustrates the additional work (defining aidl
  interfaces) needed to interact with a service in another process.  Also
  shows how a service can publish multiple interfaces and implement
  callbacks to its clients.</dd>

  <dt><a href="ServiceStartArguments.html">Service Start Arguments Controller</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how you can use a Service as a job queue, where you 
  submit jobs to it with {@link android.content.Context#startService
  Context.startService} instead of binding to the service.  Such a service
  automatically stops itself once all jobs have been processed.  This can be
  a very convenient way to interact with a service when you do not need
  a result back from it.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="ForegroundService.html">Foreground Service Controller</a></dt>
  <dd>Shows how you
  can write a Service that runs in the foreground and works on both pre-2.0
  and post-2.0 versions of the platform.  This example will selectively use
  the new foreground APIs that were introduced in Android 2.0 if they are
  available.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Alarm</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="AlarmController.html">Alarm Controller</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates two ways you can schedule alarms: a one-shot alarm that
  will happen once at a given time, and a repeating alarm that will happen
  first at a given time and then continually trigger at regular intervals
  after that.
  <dl>
  <dt>Code:
  <dd> <a href="AlarmController.html">AlarmController.java</a>
  <dd> <a href="OneShotAlarm.html">OneShotAlarm.java</a>
  <dd> <a href="RepeatingAlarm.html">RepeatingAlarm.java</a>
  <dt>Layout:
  <dd> <a href="../../../../../../res/layout/alarm_controller.html">
  alarm_controller.xml</a>
  </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="AlarmService.html">Alarm Service</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how you can schedule an alarm that causes a service to
    be started.  This is useful when you want to schedule alarms that initiate
    long-running operations, such as retrieving recent e-mails.
  <dl>
  <dt>Code:
  <dd> <a href="AlarmService.html">AlarmService.java</a>
  <dd> <a href="AlarmService_Service.html">AlarmService_Service.java</a>
  <dt>Layout:
  <dd> <a href="../../../../../../res/layout/alarm_service.html">
  alarm_service.xml</a>
  </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Notification</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="NotifyWithText.html">NotifyWithText</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates popup notifications of varying length.</dd>

  <dt><a href="IncomingMessage.html">IncomingMessage</a></dt>
  <dd> Demonstrates sending persistent and transient notifications, with a View object in the notification. It also demonstrated inflating a View object from an XML layout resource. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Search</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="SearchInvoke.html">SearchInvoke</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates various ways in which activities can launch the Search UI.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="SearchQueryResults.html">SearchQueryResults</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates an activity that receives Search intents and handles them.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="SearchSuggestionSampleProvider.html">SearchSuggestionSampleProvider</a></dt>
  <dd>Demonstrates how to configure and use the built-in "recent queries" suggestion provider.</dd>  
</dl>
