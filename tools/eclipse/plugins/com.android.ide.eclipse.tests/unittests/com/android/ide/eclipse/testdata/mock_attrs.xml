         What this contains:
         - View

         - some attributes which format are defined in Theme
         - orientation, gravity and layout_gravity defined before they are used

         - LinearLayout
         - LinearLayout_Layout
         - TableLayout
         
         Note that TableLayout does not have a TableLayout_Layout definition here
