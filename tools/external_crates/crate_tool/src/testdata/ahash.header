Subject: [PATCH] Use /dev/urandom instead of getrandom()

To generate the ahash crate's default hash keys, use /dev/urandom
instead of getrandom() to avoid blocking boot on systems where the
entropy pool isn't initialized in time and where the use case of this
crate doesn't actually require cryptographic randomness.

If opening or reading from /dev/urandom fails, fall back to getrandom().

Note that std::collections::HashMap doesn't block for randomness either,
for the same reason.  So this change just makes ahash work like HashMap.
