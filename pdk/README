Building the pdk (platform development kit)

1) get a cupcake source tree with all the normal tools... and add doxygen 
(We currently support version 1.4.6)

  sudo apt-get install doxygen

2) from the root
  . build/envsetup.sh

3) run choosecombo
  Build for the simulator or the device?
       1. Device
       2. Simulator

  Which would you like? [1] 1


  Build type choices are:
       1. release
       2. debug

  Which would you like? [1] 1


  Product choices are:
       0. emulator
       1. generic
       2. sim
       3. surf
  You can also type the name of a product if you know it.
  Which would you like? [generic] 1


  Variant choices are:
       1. user
       2. userdebug
       3. eng
  Which would you like? [eng] 3

  ============================================
  TARGET_PRODUCT=generic
  TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT=eng
  TARGET_SIMULATOR=false
  TARGET_BUILD_TYPE=release
  TARGET_ARCH=arm
  HOST_ARCH=x86
  HOST_OS=linux
  HOST_BUILD_TYPE=release
  BUILD_ID=
  ============================================

4) mkdir dist
   mkdir logs
   mkpdkcupcake.sh

(which contains: 

DT=`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
time make -j4 pdk pdk_all dist DIST_DIR=dist 2>&1 | tee logs/$DT

so you can see the results of the build in the logs directory.)

5) the pdk tar file is put in the dist directory.


The build target 'pdk' brings in the pdk/ndk make files into the build system.
 Then there are three targets:
  pdk_docs - which builds the pdk documentation
  ndk - which builds the native development kit (native compiler, linker, etc.)
  pdk_all - which builds the above two targets

for doxygen version changing you can pass in the variable:
doxygen_version='<path/name_of_doxygen_executable>'
on the make line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To host the pdk docs on appengine run:
/home/build/static/projects/apphosting/devtools/appcfg.py update pdk/
where the pdk directory contains: pdk.py, app.yaml, and the docs directory,
all of which are tarred up by the Pdk.mk file when using the targer pdk_docs.
