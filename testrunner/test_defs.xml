This file contains standard test definitions for the Android platform

Java tests are defined by <test> tags and native ones (C/C++) are defined by
<test-native> tags.

JAVA/application tests:
=======================
  The java <test> element has the following attributes

  name package [class runner build_path coverage_target continuous description]

  Where:
  name: Self-descriptive name used to uniquely identify the test
  build_path: File system path, relative to Android build root, to this
    package's Android.mk file. If omitted, build/sync step for this test will
    be skipped.
  package: Android application package that contains the tests
  class: Optional. Fully qualified Java test class to run.
  runner: Fully qualified InstrumentationTestRunner to execute. If omitted,
     will default to android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner.
  coverage_target: Build name of Android package this test targets - these
    targets are defined in the coverage_targets.xml file.  Used as basis for
    code coverage metrics. If omitted, code coverage will not be supported for
    this test.
  continuous: Optional boolean. Default is false. Set to true if tests are known
    to be reliable, and should be included in a continuous test system. false if
    they are under development.

  description: Optional string. Default is empty. Short description (typically
     less than 60 characters) about this test.

  These attributes map to the following commands:
  (if class is defined)
      adb shell am instrument -w <package>/<runner>
  (else)
      adb shell am instrument -w -e class <class> <package>/<runner>

Native tests:
=============
  The <test-native> element has the following attributes

  name build_path [continuous description]

  Where:
  name: Self-descriptive name used to uniquely identify the test
  build_path: File system path, relative to Android build root, to this
     package's Android.mk file. By convention the name of a test should match:
      - test_*.[cc|cpp]
      - *_test.[cc|cpp]
      - *_unittest.[cc|cpp]

  continuous: Optional boolean. Default is false. Set to true if tests are known
     to be reliable, and should be included in a continuous test system.
     false if they are under development.
  description: Optional string. Default is empty. Short description (typically
     less than 60 characters) about this test.
  extra_make_args: Optional string. Default is empty. Some test module require
     extra make arguments to build. This string is append to the make command.

  These attributes map to the following commands:
    make <build_path>/Android.mk <extra_make_args>
    adb sync
    for test_prog in <tests built>; do
      adb shell "/system/bin/${test_prog} >/dev/null 2>&1;echo \$?"
      adb shell "rm /system/bin/${test_prog}"
    done
